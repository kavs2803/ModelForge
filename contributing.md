# ENTER MODELFORGE

Ready to make some magic happen with ModelForge? Whether it's your first time forking a repo or you're a seasoned coder, we're excited to have you here! This doc will help you join the action. But first, grab some snacks, maybe a bunsamosa (:p), and let’s lay down some ground rules.

## What is This? 🛠️

This is ModelForge—our low-code ML framework designed to make model-building as smooth as butter. Your contributions are going to make it even cooler, and hacknights are the perfect time to bring in fresh energy, and here's how you can get started:

## Ground Rules Before the Fun Begins 🧑‍💻

1. **Fork it! Clone it!**  
   Fork the repo, clone your copy, and fire up your text editor of choice (we recommend VS Code, but you do you!).

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ModelForge.git
   ```

Keep your forks synced with the main repo. You don't want to be stuck in a merge-conflict meltdown later. 🎭
```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```
Create Cool Stuff—But Keep it in a Branch! 🌱
Hack away in a new branch. Create one for each feature, bugfix, or improvement.
```bash
git checkout -b my-awesome-feature
```
When you're happy, push it to your fork. Then open a Pull Request and let the magic happen!
```bash
git push origin my-awesome-feature
```

Stay Fresh, Stay Updated 🔄
If you've been away, sync with the upstream repo before pushing your PR. Stay up to date to avoid any surprises in the merge.

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```
